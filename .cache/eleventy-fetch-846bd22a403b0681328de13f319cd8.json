On Wednesday the 1st of August, nine settlers attacked the village of Tuba, targeting the villagers’ well by setting up a tent over it, making it impossible for anyone else to access the water for the entire day. The settlers were escorted and protected by two jeeps of military and police personnel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the 5th of August, another gratuitous case of violence by the occupation affected our community. After a group of settlers invaded the land, a member of Youth of Sumud, </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CvnNprntevL/?img_index=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mohammed Hureini, 19 years old, was arrested</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while grazing his sheep on his family land. The army came and handcuffed and blindfolded Mohammed, </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvk2u-5tC0y/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">detaining him for hours</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the military base, he was forced to lay on the ground without moving for two hours. Once released, he was left in front of the entrance of a settlement, leaving him to walk 5 km before reaching his home, also ignoring the immense danger this would expose him to if a settler were to attack him while walking this distance.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_57\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"397\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-post-45 wp-image-57\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_600,h_397/f_auto,q_auto/v1694174386/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.00-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.00-PM.jpeg?_i=AA\" alt=\"Snapshots of the arrest of Mohammed Hureini on the 5th of August.\" data-public-id=\"WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.00-PM.jpeg\" data-format=\"jpeg\" data-transformations=\"f_auto,q_auto\" data-version=\"1694174386\" data-responsive=\"1\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_448,h_296/f_auto,q_auto/v1694174386/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.00-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.00-PM.jpeg?_i=AA 448w, https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_248,h_164/f_auto,q_auto/v1694174386/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.00-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.00-PM.jpeg?_i=AA 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-57\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Snapshots of the arrest of Mohammed Hureini on the 5th of August.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the night between Sunday the 6th and Monday the 7th of August, at around 4 a.m., 25 Israeli soldiers came marching into the village of Tuba, raiding the house of one of the villagers. On Monday, then, the army confiscated a generator from a family in the village of Jinba. On Tuesday, soldiers invaded a house in Maghayr al-Abid, holding the family at gunpoint, with the excuse of searching the house for weapons, which of course were not existent. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CvxHXkftgO_/?img_index=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On August 10th</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, only five days after his arrest, Mohammed Hureini was stopped by the army while driving his car in Yatta. After being ordered to lay on the ground, with guns pointed at him the soldiers searched the car. Once again, nothing remotely suspicious or illegal was found inside of the car, but Mohammed was still handcuffed, blindfolded, and beaten. While being driven to the military base, without charge, the soldiers threatened to abandon him in the desert. Eventually, after hours of interrogation, he was released under the condition of paying a fine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, the school year has started, and with that, our commitment to accompany the children who, to reach their schools, need to cross the settlement of Ma’on. Our job consists of walking for part of the road with the kids as well as making sure the army comes every morning at 7 a.m. to walk the children in the middle of the settlement, a hotspot of violence, and to do the same once the school day is over.  The children still face constant attacks at the hands of settlers as they travel to and from their schools. Moreover, the army often will arrive late or not show up at all, as happened on the 21st of August. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the 22nd of August, three settlers from the illegal outpost of Avat Ma’on arrived in the village of Tuba with their flock. Once asked to leave the land, </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CwQR7PntRgz/?img_index=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the settlers pepper-sprayed three </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the family members. On the same night, settlers gathered in the village of Susya, and one of them arrived by horse and fired a gunshot to terrorize the villagers.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_51\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"634\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-post-45 wp-image-51\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_600,h_634/f_auto,q_auto/v1694173536/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.41.19-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.41.19-PM.jpeg?_i=AA\" alt=\"One of the villagers from Tuba receiving medical help after the attack carried out by settlers on the 22nd of August.\" data-public-id=\"WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.41.19-PM.jpeg\" data-format=\"jpeg\" data-transformations=\"f_auto,q_auto\" data-version=\"1694173536\" data-responsive=\"1\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_448,h_473/f_auto,q_auto/v1694173536/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.41.19-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.41.19-PM.jpeg?_i=AA 448w, https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_248,h_262/f_auto,q_auto/v1694173536/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.41.19-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.41.19-PM.jpeg?_i=AA 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-51\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of the villagers from Tuba receiving medical help after the attack carried out by settlers on the 22nd of August.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the 23rd of August, we received a warning of the demolition of the school in Fakhit. However, an appeal has been made on this case; whilst the demolition might not be as imminent as we first thought, we are still highly alert to the situation in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this continuous violence, here at Youth of Sumud, alongside other local and international activists, we continue to organize and resist. Other than our daily practices of accompanying children and shepherds and intervening when there is a risk of confrontation, this month we have organized two events to draw activists from all of Palestine to join us. On the 19th of August, around 100 activists joined us to take part in the event Yom al Masafer. We set up a range of activities that would allow them to understand the reality of living in the firing zone. As a follow-up, on the 28th of August, we organized the event of Shams al Masafer, during which we planted trees in the villages of Mufaggara, Khalet al-Daba and at-Tuwani.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, on the 31st of August we organized an </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CwnvS4Wt1D1/?img_index=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action in response to the policy of car confiscations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the area of Masafer Yatta. Since the Israeli Occupation Forces limited our movements in the area through this tactic, we organized a march to reach the village of Jinba with donkeys, an old and traditional method of transportation in this area. We call on everyone to come to Masafer Yatta to break all these occupation policies of isolation under the excuse of a military firing zone.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_52\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"751\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-post-45 wp-image-52\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_600,h_751/f_auto,q_auto/v1694173583/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.26-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.26-PM.jpeg?_i=AA\" alt=\"A picture from the action organised by Youth of Sumud on the 31st of August agains the policy of car confiscations by the IOF\" data-public-id=\"WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.26-PM.jpeg\" data-format=\"jpeg\" data-transformations=\"f_auto,q_auto\" data-version=\"1694173583\" data-responsive=\"1\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_448,h_560/f_auto,q_auto/v1694173583/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.26-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.26-PM.jpeg?_i=AA 448w, https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/images/w_248,h_310/f_auto,q_auto/v1694173583/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.26-PM/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-08-at-2.39.26-PM.jpeg?_i=AA 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-52\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A picture from the action organised by Youth of Sumud on the 31st of August against the policy of car confiscations by the IOF</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To us, it is essential that the violence we face, and the resistance we enact, is heard and talked about.
