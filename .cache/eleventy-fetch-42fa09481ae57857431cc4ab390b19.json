From protective presence in communities and planting olives to developing advocacy initiatives and local organizing, we work directly with local Palestinian groups resisting Israeli settler-colonialism and apartheid. Supporting in tangible ways means being physically present, providing legal and political analysis, facilitating financial support, and overcoming often overlooked obstacles in movement work such as technology development. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a digital presence is absolutely critical when advancing a movement of liberation. Millions of Palestinians and the solidarity movement around them turn to social media channels every day to advocate for a free Palestine. They use these tools to highlight the mechanisms of Israeli ethnic cleansing. But with Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok censoring critical voices, individuals and political formations in Palestine must develop their digital organizing tools, such as websites for international organizing and advocacy. However, when Palestinians are facing eviction, having their homes demolished, their children imprisoned and killed — community organizers who are on the front lines confronting Israeli violence simply don&#8217;t have the additional capacity to develop and optimize websites, deal with security and monitoring concerns, or have the programming background fix problems when they arise. The Good Shepherd Collective is stepping in to fill this need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a website, local groups lose the ability to fully represent themselves. There is not a static, consistent space for them to tell their unique stories or outline the ways solidarity groups can contribute directly in meaningful ways. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok don’t offer options to build email lists, book tours, and webinars, or the infrastructure to collect online donations. These are all fundamental tools that these local organizations in Palestine need to have at their disposal to build a community of support for their important work. At the moment, local Palestinian villages and community organizers rely on outside groups to facilitate many of these important resources, disrupting their autonomy. This enables liberal Zionist groups and international legacy NGOs to engage in “resource capture”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take, for example, a community under siege and facing home demolitions. NGOs and liberal <a href=\"https://cjnv.org/\">Zionist groups</a> run massive international campaigns with a community like this at the center, rallying a broad base of support from across different movement spaces to sign petitions, organize protests, and apply pressure to political actors to momentarily sway the Israeli state’s behavior toward this community. In the end, what happens is that the community may or may not achieve some temporary relief, such as an injunction on a home demolition, while the Zionist cohabitation groups and liberal NGOs have now captured hundreds of thousands of emails — all people who are sympathetic to the cause and willing to donate. But since these local Palestinian villages have no way to collect the emails themselves, the technology to mass communicate directly with their base of support through email or SMS, Palestinian organizers and communities lose out on these necessary material resources. The Good Shepherd Collective is dedicated to supporting local groups in developing the necessary tools to reclaim these resources and receive the support that is actually intended for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most recently we <a href=\"https://youthofsumud.org\">developed a website for Youth of Sumud</a>, a small grassroots group based in Masafer Yatta using serverless architecture. Serverless architecture and static sites have gained popularity in recent years due to their high performance and numerous benefits for SEO and user experience. This approach to web development is gaining traction for many reasons, including scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment — which are all important for Palestinian community organizers that need to add additional advocacy tools to their work. </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5414\" src=\"https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-1024x488.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-200x95.png 200w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-400x191.png 400w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-600x286.png 600w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-768x366.png 768w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-800x382.png 800w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-1024x488.png 1024w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-1200x572.png 1200w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM-1536x733.png 1536w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-at-7.53.32-PM.png 1904w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><em><strong>Our first site we developed for Youth of Sumud, had an almost perfect score on Google Page Insights — a site that test performance, SEO.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One reason the GSC uses serverless architecture is that it enables us and our partners to develop and run code without micro-managing the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider handles all the server management, including scaling and maintenance, and developers only pay for the resources they use — making it an incredibly cost-effective approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main benefits of serverless architecture is its speed. Since the serverless provider manages the infrastructure, the server can respond to requests much faster than traditional server architectures. This means that static sites hosted on serverless architecture can be delivered quickly, resulting in faster load times, a critical factor for SEO and user experience. In fact, the Youth of Sumud website, the first one we&#8217;ve built, has nearly a perfect Light House Score. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lighting speed is inherent in static site generation, as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are served directly to the user without any server-side processing. Since there is no server-side processing, the site can be delivered much faster than traditional dynamic websites (like WordPress sites), resulting in faster load times and a better user experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more than just high performance, security is at the center of our development. With Israeli deploying spyware, routine hacking, security is a major factor in building a digital presence with serverless technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serverless functions and static sites are inherently more secure than traditional web applications that run on a server. Here are some ways that this architecture makes it harder for a website to be hacked:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Reduced Attack Surface: Traditional web applications are composed of multiple layers such as the server, database, web application server, etc., and all these layers have their own vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. In contrast, serverless functions and static sites have a minimal attack surface since there are no servers to manage, no operating systems to patch, and no databases to manage.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Stateless Architecture: Serverless functions are stateless, which means that they do not maintain any state between requests. This makes it difficult for an attacker to hijack a session or carry out a denial-of-service attack, as each request is handled independently.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Limited Access: Serverless functions typically run in a sandboxed environment, meaning they have limited access to system resources and can only access the resources they need to execute their code. This reduces the potential attack surface and limits the impact of a security breach.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Automatic Scaling: Serverless functions and static sites are designed to scale automatically based on incoming traffic. This means there is no need to provision additional resources to handle spikes in traffic, which can introduce vulnerabilities if the resources are not properly configured.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Third-Party Libraries: Serverless functions and static sites often rely on third-party libraries and services, which are maintained by dedicated teams of developers and are regularly updated to fix security vulnerabilities. This reduces the burden on individual developers to maintain and update their own code, which can be a significant source of vulnerabilities.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, SEO is another critical factor where serverless architecture and static sites excel. One of the most important factors for SEO is the site&#8217;s speed, and serverless architecture and static sites offer blazing-fast loading times. Furthermore, static sites have a simple structure, making it easy for search engines to crawl and index. This will result in better search engine rankings, which will drive more organic traffic to our partners&#8217; sites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we&#8217;ve laid out, serverless functions and static sites offer a more secure architecture for web applications, with a reduced attack surface, stateless architecture, limited access, automatic scaling, third-party libraries, and serverless security. By leveraging these features, we can focus on building robust digital tools for our partners on the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serverless architecture and static sites offer numerous benefits for SEO and user experience. They are scalable, cost-effective, easy to deploy, and highly secure. They also offer fast loading times, which is a critical factor for both SEO and user experience. Therefore, it is critical to consider serverless architecture and static sites when building websites within our movement to ensure optimal performance and user engagement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But we can’t do this alone.

400;\">2023 is on pace to set the record for Israeli administrative home demolitions. Since the beginning of the year, Israel has demolished 289 Palestinian structures, displacing over 400 people, nearly half of whom are children. At the current rate, Israel will destroy almost 1,200 Palestinian homes and facilities by the end of the year. Since 2017, home demolitions have been steadily increasing every year. In 2017 there were 422 demolitions in the West Bank and Jerusalem, followed by 463 in 2018, 632 in 2019, 857 in 2020, 911 in 2021, and 952 in 2022. This rise in demolitions correlates with the sharp increase of right-wing charitable formations funneling money into Israeli organizations like Regavim, Ir David, and Ateret Cohanim. </span></p>\n<table role=\"presentation\" border=\"1px\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">\n<table border=\"1px\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Data from January 1, 2023 to April 2, 2023.</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Donor</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Funded</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Structures</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Demolished</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Israeli</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Operations</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">43</span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">289</span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">113</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Impact on Palestinian Lives</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">\n<table role=\"presentation\" border=\"1px\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Type</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Displaced</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Affected</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Structures</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Households</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">59</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">1,838</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Residential: 72</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">People</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">401</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">11,280</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Agricultural: 86</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Males</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">212</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">5,955</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Livelihood: 54</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Females</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">191</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">5,323</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">WASH: 27</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Children</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">194</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #000000;\">4,891</span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"#ececec\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Infrastructure: 6</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Others: 14</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The material conditions on the ground reflect the new inroads that the Israeli settler movement has made in the centers of power. This is illustrated not only with the rise in demolitions, killings, and the incarceration of Palestinians, but through absurd power grabs — such as Prime Minister Netanyahu gifting ultra-radical settler MK Itamar Ben Gvir his own personal militia. It is clear that the trajectory of Israeli politics is its consolidation into a religious theocracy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the trend of violence and indigenous dispossession continue, the international solidarity movement needs to usher in a new liberatory praxis and utilize tactics that take aim at the structures of violence through policy change and legal reform. Contrary to popular belief, perpetual webinars and book readings will not lead to a future of Palestinian emancipation. No matter how well attended, these social events are not an end in themselves. International solidarity groups have to link their activities to winnable, impactful campaigns. The future of Palestine depends on it. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5396\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5396\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5396\" src=\"https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-1024x1005.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1005\" srcset=\"https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-66x66.png 66w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-200x196.png 200w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-300x295.png 300w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-400x393.png 400w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-600x589.png 600w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-768x754.png 768w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-800x786.png 800w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-1024x1005.png 1024w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim-1200x1178.png 1200w, https://goodshepherdcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Regavim.png 1436w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-5396\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A screenshot of the Regavim Whatsapp group celebrating the demolition order of a Palestinian school in Bethlehem.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, Regavim, an openly racist Israeli settler organization specializing in legal campaigns to lobby for Palestinian displacement, celebrated their most recent victory: a new demolition order for the Jubbet al-Dhib school in eastern Bethlehem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jubbet al-Dhib has long been a target of the zionist movement, destroyed in 2017, and its solar panels were previously confiscated by Israeli forces. For the last five years, they&#8217;ve exhausted resources to keep the school serving their embattled community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;After a 5-year legal battle, we won a major judgment in the Jerusalem District Court in our petition against the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s illegal school in the Herodion National Park,&#8221; said Regavim&#8217;s Social Media Coordinator, Sam Whitefield. &#8220;The decision orders the illegal structure to be sealed off immediately, and demolished within 60 days.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Jubbet al-Dhib is not located in the Herodion National Park, but due west several kilometers.]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With millions of dollars funneled through U.S., Canadian, and U.K. charitable foundations, Regavims deploys field workers to surveil and document Palestinian construction and employs lawyers and lobbyists to build pressure in the Knesset to facilitate the erasure of the indigenous Palestinian population. This is manifested in acts such as home demolitions, land confiscations, and new laws that strip the original inhabitants of Palestine of their lands and fundamental rights. Regavim was a major advocate of the Nation-State law and is one of the leading voices calling for dismantling the Israeli court system in favor of one replaced by the radical settler movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regavim is one piece of a larger consortium that, against charitable regulations, has either set up ghost charities or partnered with suspect institutions to fund the colonization of Palestine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A broad base of Palestinian organizations and civic activists have called for the international solidarity movement to develop and execute their own localized campaigns to stop the financing of these settler organizations.

Data</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s critical to remember that while Israel&#8217;s use of home demolitions is a constant tool for indigenous displacement and erasure, the ebbs and flows of this formal policy’s execution are shaped by different political formations. A rise in home demolitions almost always corresponds to the power of the most fascist, right-wing elements in Israeli society. Therefore, it is no surprise that demolition metrics are up across the board. There is a 155% increase in displaced people compared to last year&#8217;s timeframe (January 1 through March 2, 2022, compared to January 1 through March 2, 2023). These numbers don&#8217;t account for the number of demolitions that happen inside the Green Line in places like the Naqab or the Galilee regions as well as other non-Jewish communities.</p>\n<p>Organizations like Regavim, Ir David, the Hebron, and Ateret Cohanim have all funneled hundreds of millions of charitable donations through channels in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. to develop political programs that ushered in more robust, aggressive, and permanent policies that structured to erase Palestinian communities and replace them.</p>\n<p>These financial structures have been essential in financing the ultra right-wing government, with members of the aforementioned organizations all utilizing their previous organizations to make inroads into the government and ultimately gaining MK positions — like Bezalel Smotrich — the co-founder of Regavim.</p>\n<p>Dismantling the financial mechanisms that underpin the settler movement must take an elevated position within the Palestinian movement for liberation if we want to prevent the next Huwara.

When asked about this in an interview on Wednesday, March 1, Smotrich doubled down, calling for the state to carry out this eradication. He argued that he believes the state has an obligation to do this, not its settler citizens. He was not being facetious.</p>\n<p>Bezalel Smotrich, co-founder of Regavim, has spent most of his career dedicated to exactly what he described in this interview: the displacement and destruction of Palestinian communities. Through building relationships with the military, surveilling Palestinian communities, and lobbying for their destruction through court petitions and political engagement in the Knesset, Smotrich has worked hard to convince the state to increase its use of violence against vulnerable communities. Among the most prominent examples of his former organization’s targets are Khan al Ahmar — which is not facing potentially imminent displacement &#8211; and Khallet ad Dabe’, a small hamlet in Masafer Yatta that is also at immediate risk.</p>\n<p>Among other settler leaders like Itamar Ben Gvir and Yishai Fleisher (spokesman for the Hebron Fund), Smotrich is speaking openly and honestly about his hopes for the elimination of indigenous Palestinians. Palestinians know that we must take these threats seriously, and we need our allies to understand their significance. As structural and individual acts of violence mount against Palestinians and our communities, we must disrupt the international support going to the organizations mounting the pressure and making it ever more appealing for the state to move forward with drastic measures.</p>\n<p>Read more about Regavim, the settler organization pushing for Khan al Ahmar and many other communities&#8217; displacement, and what you can do here: <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/\">defundracism.org</a></p>\n</div></div></div></div></div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Tuesday, January 17th, in collaboration with Sabeel, the Good Shepherd Collective’s Bana Abu Zuluf and Youth of Sumud’s Sami Huraini will discuss the impending ethnic cleansing of some 1,500 Palestinians living in a collection of small villages across Masafer Yatta. </p>\n","protected":false},"author":17,"featured_media":5382,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[18,62,71],"tags":[44,99,100],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.8 (Yoast SEO v20.8) - https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/ -->\n<title>GSC Demolition Report | Feb 2023 - Good Shepherd Collective</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The Israeli state began 2023 with a clear effort to move aggressively forward, carrying out demolitions against Palestinian families.

NGO&#8217;s registered in the US, Canada and the UK, the Israeli settler movement took seige of parts of Nablus. This is some of the aftermath.</p></div>\n<h1>Settler movement given greenlight to organize attacks</h1>\n<p>As we move toward Ramadan this year, Israeli forces and settlers are ramping up violence against Palestinian communities everywhere. While these escalations are a pattern of the Israeli state, they have increased with the new far right Israeli coalition controlling the government.</p>\n<p>Last week Israeli forces stormed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1628363151254204416\">Nablus</a> in broad daylight, entering a busy market in the center of the city and killing a total of eleven people. Among those murdered were a boy who was fleeing live fire, two elderly men, and Palestinians who were part of organized resistance. The Israeli forces injured more than a hundred more Palestinians during this massacre, using tear gas and shooting with live fire.</p>\n<p>In Palestine, as we—like many others—reported on this attack, tweeting about it live, we watched in horror as the number of Palestinians killed at the hands of Israeli forces continued to grow. Local residents shared clips of drones overhead, soldiers in the center of their city, live ammunition, and tear gas. This was an attack on a major city at a time when Israeli forces knew the area would be crowded and busy. It was no coincidence that so many Palestinians were injured, most of them by live ammunition.</p>\n<p>This is only the latest attack in a series. Since the beginning of the year, Israeli forces have carried out attacks in Jericho and Jenin which killed more than fifteen people combined in attempts to quash Palestinian resistance.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/abualex/image/upload/v1677586269/malkha-fleisher-600.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /> <span class=\"inline-caption\">Caption: Malkah Fleisher is an outspoken settler from Hebron and wife of Yishai Fleisher, the spokesperson for the settler organization Hebron Fund. Both Malkah and Yishai have used their positions in the settler movement to cultivate a milieu of violence and racism.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p>On, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1630275929153888257\">February 26</a>, Israeli settlers attacked Huwara, a Palestinian town south of Nablus. Nearby Huwara are many Israeli settlements and outposts with reputations for violent assaults on Palestinians–among them, <a href=\"https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/17738.html\">Yitzhar</a>. Escorted by Israeli forces who served as armed protectors, hundreds of Israeli settlers poured into the town and burned between 30 and 100 cars, torched homes, and killed at least one Palestinian man. Many others were attacked, stabbed, shot, beaten, and many of those not attacked directly by settlers suffered from tear gas inhalation. Settlers are also reported to have attacked the nearby villages of Burin and Qaryout.</p>\n<p>Israeli politicians and public figures have rushed to distance themselves from this undeniably inhumane assault on Palestinians of all stripes—with Netanyahu notably asking citizens not to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-sends-more-troops-into-occupied-west-bank-after-latest-wave-of-violence\">“take the law into their own hands”</a> after working to make guns more accessible to Israelis only a month ago. Still, claims that this violence is not the true character of the state, or that zionism is not based on violence and Jewish supremacy, are nothing but attempts to distort reality.</p>\n<p>The ongoing, mounting attacks by Israeli settlers and armed forces alike are only the latest iteration of Israeli colonial violence, which exists to forcibly displace Palestinians from their homeland through resource theft and violence. And while we could spend all day dissecting the racism underpinning the responses from American politicians such as State Department spokesman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1630212516419719171\">Ned Price</a>, what Palestinians need is not another empty gesture, call for senators to apologize for meeting with Israeli politicians, or articulation that zionism is not Judaism. They certainly do not need allies to fundraise for the legacy NGOs in the global north.</p>\n<p>Palestinians need allies abroad to engage in processes that strip resources directly from the actors engaging in the destruction—political action that solidarity partners can begin in their own communities. This means going beyond education to effect change in our communities. While GSC and our partners on the ground have put forth the Defund Racism campaign to disrupt the funding going to organizations like the Hebron Fund—whose spokesperson affirmed that the settlers involved in the Huwara attack are zionists representing many Israelis—or Regavim, that is not the only way forward. But solidarity that remains in the form of words and sympathetic gestures is no longer enough.</p>\n<p>All of our local research, organizing and international coordination is funded by individual donors willing to invest in the work by giving <a href=\"https://goodshepherdcollective.org/give\">5, 10, 30, and 60 dollars a month</a>. The essential, liberatory work that we are doing is out of the scope of nearly all funding institutions. In this way, the success of our work hinges on people such as yourself who are willing to sacrifice a few dollars each month to ensure that we’re able to pay the bills, keep the lights on, support ourselves and those around us, and keep moving forward with our analysis and contributions to resistance.</p>\n<p>We’re asking you to make a monthly commitment to keep this work expanding. <a href=\"https://goodshepherdcollective.org/give\">Click here to make that commitment today</a>.</p>\n</div></div></div></div></div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Tuesday, January 17th, in collaboration with Sabeel, the Good Shepherd Collective’s Bana Abu Zuluf and Youth of Sumud’s Sami Huraini will discuss the impending ethnic cleansing of some 1,500 Palestinians living in a collection of small villages across Masafer Yatta. </p>\n","protected":false},"author":17,"featured_media":5386,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[18,62,71],"tags":[44,99,100],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.8 (Yoast SEO v20.8) - https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/ -->\n<title>Horrors in Nablus - Good Shepherd Collective</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Embolden by new power in the Israeli Knesset and hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through NGO&#039;s registered in the US, Canada and the UK, the Israeli settler movement took seige of parts of Nablus.

Between January and the first few days of February, Israeli forces demolished 147 structures in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, displacing 210 people and affecting more than 3,600 total (UN OCHA). Among the structures, homes made up the most significant type of structure to be demolished, followed by agricultural structures and other buildings relating to livelihood.</p>\n<p>On February 2nd, Israeli forces demolished two homes belonging to brothers Muhammad Ali and Khaled Muleihat in Duma. In demolishing five structures, including a water well and a farmhouse, three families totaling 15 people — including nine children are homeless in the middle of the winter and rainy season. According to reports, the families had filed a legal injunction through JLAC to stop the demolitions, but the demolitions were carried out regardless.</p>\n<p>This demolition and displacement of these families resulted in the horrific video above, evoking memories of Palestinian displacement in the Nakba, Naksa, and the ongoing threat of ethnic cleansing for our communities across Palestine. Duma is a small community located southeast of Nablus city and surrounded by Israeli settlements. Like many other communities in Area C of the West Bank, its position and land make it a target for demolitions and attacks as part of a larger effort to displace the community and pave the way for a takeover of the land by Israeli settlers.</p>\n<p>This campaign of demolishing Palestinian homes while it has always been a key feature of the Israeli state. The current ultra right-wing political formations have gained new power in the Knesset, which has translated into new policy of hyper-displacement and settler violence. These ultra-right-wing political formations have been primarily financed by charitable funding from organizations registered in the US, Canada, the UK, and elsewhere.

With <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/regavim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the ultra right-wing organization Regavim</a> continuously lobbying the courts to force the government to take violent action and destroy the community and the very settlers who are engaged in legal attacks and land takeovers in prominent government positions — now is the time for the international community to step up its support for the community.</p>\n<p>Eid al Khamis, a spokesman for the community, has stated that he believes the state has begun preparing for the demolition of the village and displacement of its residents, with settler leaders Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich considering this a top priority to move forward with the E1 settlement plans and finalizing Israeli control over all of the Jerusalem area. On January 23, a tour of the area by Likud members resulted in their public call for the destruction of the village. While there is a delay, many believe that the forced displacement of the 200 community members may be forthcoming within the year. While al Khamis has reiterated the community&#8217;s determination to remain, he has also described the trauma and anxiety its Palestinian residents face under the weight of the possible ethnic cleansing, &#8220;Everyone here is apprehensive. The residents cannot sleep or rest, especially the children and women&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Read more about Khan al Ahmar <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20230117-over-200-palestinians-at-risk-of-forced-eviction-in-khan-al-ahmar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Read more about Regavim, the settler organization pushing for Khan al Ahmar and many other communities&#8217; displacement, and what you can do here: <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/\">defundracism.org</a></p>\n</div></div></div></div></div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Tuesday, January 17th, in collaboration with Sabeel, the Good Shepherd Collective’s Bana Abu Zuluf and Youth of Sumud’s Sami Huraini will discuss the impending ethnic cleansing of some 1,500 Palestinians living in a collection of small villages across Masafer Yatta. </p>\n","protected":false},"author":17,"featured_media":5357,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[18,62,71],"tags":[99,100,98],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.8 (Yoast SEO v20.8) - https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/ -->\n<title>GSC Demolition Report | Jan 2023 - Good Shepherd Collective</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The Israeli state began 2023 with a clear effort to move aggressively forward, carrying out demolitions against Palestinian families.

the Good Shepherd Collective and Sabeel.</a></p>\n<h1>Invest in the movement in Palestine</h1>\n<p>This Tuesday, January 17th, in collaboration with Sabeel, the Good Shepherd Collective’s Bana Abu Zuluf and Youth of Sumud’s Sami Huraini will discuss the impending ethnic cleansing of some 1,500 Palestinians living in a collection of small villages across Masafer Yatta. We’ll be discussing the grassroots resistance on the ground and the need for international solidarity to disrupt the flow of charitable donations to the settler organizations enacting this program of indigenous erasure. Make sure to join us by <a href=\"http://zoom.us/j/94679502800\">following this link</a>.</p>\n<p>We will also be having another webinar January 27 with Just Peace Advocates and<a href=\"https://www.foreignpolicy.ca/\"> Canadian Foreign Policy Institute (CFPI)</a> to discuss the work that is being done in Canada within the framework of the Defund Racism campaign. Make sure to follow our social media accounts for promotional material and the webinar link.</p>\n<p>Israel killed 45-year-old Palestinian man Ahmad Kahla just outside of Ramallah today. Omar Lutfi Khumour just died of wounds sustained earlier today by Israeli gunfire in Dheisheh refugee camp, in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. He marks the 14th Palestinian executed on the streets in the first 16 days of 2023, including 3 children.</p>\n<p>With an embolden right-wing government formation taking full rein in the new Israeli government, nearly every metric of violence with the intent to displace and erase Palestinians is on the rise, including Palestinian home demolitions which are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shepherds4Good/status/1612083445517193217?s=20&amp;t=6DoS0nxakjCjn-ujnRJP1w\">projected to reach the highest yearly total ever</a>.</p>\n<p>Couple this with social media outlets routinely silencing or completely shutting down voices calling for Palestinian liberation, and we are at a crossroads: either we begin to invest in winnable, strategic campaigns of structural change and support in Palestinian resistance and political aspirations outside of the rigid, NGO ecosystem – or we have to stop lamenting Israeli domination.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2013/04/against-the-law\">Read Menza Qato and Kareem Rabie’s piece on this here</a>]</p>\n<p>The Good Shepherd Collective advocates for a two-prong approach: (1) adopting the <a href=\"https://defundracism.org/\">Defund Racism campaign</a>, an initiative that takes aim at the structures and personalities underwriting the settler enterprise, and (2) helping to develop local communication and advocacy capacities of local grassroots formations. The Good Shepherd Collective is working on developing the capacities and building out the tools for our local partners, with new websites, email systems, and streamlining social media activities. But we can’t do this without you.</p>\n<p>You help by doing two things. First, sign and share the Defund Racism campaign and ask your networks to do the same. Second, we need your investment to ensure we have the resources to develop the communication structures that these local groups need. We need your financial support.
